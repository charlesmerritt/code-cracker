This is a simple brute force program that reads through a dictionary txt file and automatically tries every password sequentially. 
No functionality for password lockouts, not tested on sites other than pastebin.co
REQUIRES GECKODRIVER.EXE TO BE PLACED IN PROJECT DIRECTORY IF USING WITH FIREFOX.

Admittedly it's not very fast, I would love to make it faster. I have another version of this program that is marginally faster, I'll add that one as a branch.
